In task 1, we created the “IJob” interface to display information about the code. We created 3 classes that contain a method for displaying information depending on the entered code. Task2 we created an abstract class “BaseFigure” to describe such common fields like: name, area, perimeter. We created 3 classes for triangle, circle, rectangle. We created objects of these classes in the "Runner" class for each figure. We put all these objects into an array. We iterated through the array with a for-each loop and printed the information to the console.
